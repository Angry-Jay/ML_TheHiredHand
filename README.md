# The Hired Hand

## Description of the dataset
The [Job Placement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/job-placement-dataset/data) has been extensively utilized by the data science community on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub, primarily as an entry-level problem to demonstrate binary classification and introductory regression for salary prediction. Existing solutions typically follow a uniform methodology: preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The prevalent algorithms used are the Logistic Regression model for a baseline and Random Forest Classifiers as an improved solution, often yielding accuracies around $80\%-90\%$. More advanced research has even applied the dataset to explore complex topics like Explainable AI (XAI) and bias analysis, revealing potential predispositions (e.g., gender bias) within the data that influence placement prediction.This project's strategy is to build upon this existing body of work. We intend to first reproduce reliable baseline results using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to validate our preprocessing pipeline and methodology. We will go further by rigorously comparing a broader range of advanced Ensemble Models and systematically employing Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search, Randomized Search) and K-fold Cross-Validation to push performance beyond typical notebook results. Furthermore, our analysis will prioritize classification metrics like F1 Score and ROC AUC to ensure the model robustly handles the class imbalance observed in many placement datasets, rather than relying solely on simple accuracy.You can see a general walkthrough of a similar project in this video: Student Placement prediction using Machine learning with python.
