# The Hired Hand

## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Project Aim(s)

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to a new, unseen dataset in order to develop a complete analytical and predictive workflow.
Using the Job Placement Dataset (Kaggle), the goal is to:
- Predict employment outcomes (Placed vs. Not Placed) using demographic, academic, and professional attributes.
- Perform full data discovery including cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature understanding, correlation analysis, and data transformation.
- Build and compare multiple classification models, evaluate performance, and conduct hyperparameter optimization.
- Interpret and justify the obtained results, identify the most influential employability factors, and propose perspectives for improvement.
- Apply a coherent and well-reasoned methodology, demonstrating mastery of the course content and good ML practices.

### 1.2 Existing Solutions (State of the Art)

Several approaches already exist for this dataset, mainly published on Kaggle and GitHub:
- **Traditional approach (HR manual screening):**
Historically, recruiters rely on heuristic filters (e.g., grade cutoffs, specialization), which is unscalable, subjective, and often inaccurate.
- **Standard ML solutions on Kaggle:**
Multiple public notebooks use classical algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and ensemble models (e.g., ExtraTrees, XGBoost).
Most studies show that tree-based ensemble methods outperform simpler baselines, as they capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
- **Common methodology trends:**
	- Basic EDA (correlations, distributions, imbalance checks)
	- Preprocessing pipelines (encoding, scaling, imputation)
	- Model comparison with accuracy, F1, and ROC-AUC

These works provide useful baselines but leave room for deeper analysis, feature engineering, and structured methodology as required in this project.
