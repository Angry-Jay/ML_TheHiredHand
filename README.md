# The Hired Hand

## Description of the dataset, its analysis aim and the chosen methodology

The primary goeal of this project is to build a robust and predictive machine learning model capable of tackling a core binary classification task: predicting whether a graduating studnt will achieve job placement or not ("Placed" vs. "Not Placed"). The motivation, central to the field of Data Science, is to provide actionable intelligence to educational institutions, allowing them to proactively intervene and support at-risk students before graduation. The specific data set used is the well-known Job Placement Dataset from Kaggle, which is categorized as a small/medium-sized tabular dataset appropriate for the classical machine learning focus of the course.

The chosen methodology strictly adheres to the established End-to-End ML Pipeline, beginning with meticulous Data Discovery and Preparation. The input data is heterogeneous, comprising both numerical features (e.g., academic percentages) and categorical features (e.g., work experience, degree specialization). A crucial initial step will involve handling any missing values, likely through imputation (e.g., replacing with the median for numerical features). Subsequently, all features must be transformed: the categorical variables require OneHotEncoding to convert nominal values into a numerical format readable by ML algorithms, while numerical features must undergo feature scaling, specifically Standardization, to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the training process. The entire sequence of preprocessing steps will be encapsulated within a Scikit-Learn Pipeline for seamless, reproducible application across training and testing sets.

For model development, the project will first establish a baseline using a linear model like Logistic Regression. The project will then explore more sophisticated algorithms from the family of Ensemble Methods, such as the Random Forest Classifier, which is known for its improved performance and robustness against overfitting compared to individual models like Decision Trees. Given the likelihood of a skewed dataset (where one class, such as "Placed," is less frequent than "Not Placed"), the model's performance will be evaluated beyond simple accuracy. Primary performance metrics will include the F1 score and the Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC), as these measures provide a more reliable assessment of the classifier's performance across both classes. Finally, the optimal model will be achieved through hyperparameter tuning, utilizing techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search combined with K-fold Cross-Validation to ensure the final solution generalizes reliably to unseen data and minimizes the risk of overfitting.
