## Project Overview

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict employment outcomes for graduating students using the **Job Placement Dataset** from Kaggle. The goal is to build a robust binary classification model that predicts whether a student will be placed (employed) or not placed based on their demographic, academic, and professional attributes.

## Dataset Information

**Dataset Name:** Job Placement Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - Job Placement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/job-placement-dataset/data)
**Size:** Small/medium-sized tabular dataset
**Type:** Binary classification problem

**Features Include:**
- **Academic Performance:** Secondary education percentage, higher secondary percentage, degree percentage
- **Educational Background:** Board of education, degree specialization, field of study
- **Professional Attributes:** Work experience, employability test scores
- **Target Variable:** Placement status (Placed / Not Placed)

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Heterogeneous data (numerical and categorical features)
- Potential class imbalance
- Real-world data with possible missing values

## Project Objectives

1. **Predict employment outcomes** (Placed vs. Not Placed) with high accuracy and reliability
2. **Conduct comprehensive data analysis** including:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Feature engineering and selection
   - Correlation analysis
3. **Build and evaluate multiple classification models** with proper validation
4. **Identify key employability factors** through feature importance analysis
5. **Apply ML best practices** throughout the pipeline
